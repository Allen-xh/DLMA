### Deep-Reinforcement Learning Multiple Access for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks (DLMA)

This is a research project I am working on :)

See full version of our paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00162.pdf) or our conference version in [IEEE ICC 2018](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8422168/).


### Carrier-Sense Multiple Access for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks Using Deep-Reinforcement Learning (CS-DLMA)
The paper introduces carrier sensing and differnt packet lengths into DLMA. This paper has been submitted to a conference on Oct. 15, 2018. See the conference version on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06830).  



Code samples will be posted soon ...
